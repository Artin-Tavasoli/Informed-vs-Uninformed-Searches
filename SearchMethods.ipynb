For example, if we have multiple layers of walls, we don't care about the second layer of walls because we can't get past the first one! Not to mention, with each move, only a slight position change happens in the map ‚Äî so the explored set and frontier sets would be very large in memory, and finding a specific element like the player's position would be very time consuming (searching each element in the map to find it).\n",

Since the player cannot move these boxes, these states will never lead to a solution. By eliminating them, we not only remove these states but also all their potential child states.  \n",
    "- **Avoiding infinite loops:** If we don't keep track of visited states and expand every neighbor, we might get stuck in an infinite loop. To prevent this, we mark visited paths and avoid re-adding a state unless it has a lower cost the second time; in that case, we update the state instead of duplicating it.  \n",
